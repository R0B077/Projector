# Projector
A new way to make fast, memory-efficient and interactive videos... welcome Projector!

# Introduction
You know how videos take a *lot* of space (if it's in a file) and Wi-Fi (if it's on the Internet) and are just something you can look at, but not really interact with? That's all going to change with Projector. Instead of displaying images, it displays HTML code set by the video creator one by one. This works only for presentation type videos and not videos that arenâ€™t presentation based because streaming images defeats the point of having a projector.
